# Changelog

All notable changes to the NotFair plugin (formerly `toprank`) will be documented here.

The format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/).

---


## [Unreleased]

## [0.27.6] — 2026-09-09

### Fixed

- Codex ads-skill wrappers now resolve canonical workflows explicitly from the installed plugin root and fail closed instead of falling back to a similarly named skill from another plugin.

## [0.27.5] — 2026-09-05

### Fixed

- Corrected the portable MCP manifest to use the Agent Plugins schema's `streamable-http` transport. Cursor's native manifest loads `.mcp.json` using its native `http` transport label. Both retain the same single NotFair connection.
- Refreshed the Cursor plugin description and publisher contact information.

## [0.27.4] — 2026-09-05

### Added

- **Portable agent marketplace manifests (v0.27.1).** Added Agent Plugins 1.0 manifests for Kiro Powers and compatible hosts, a Gemini CLI extension manifest for automatic gallery discovery, and universal NotFair Ads metadata for the official MCP Registry. Cursor and Codex now share the standards-based root MCP manifest.

- **X Ads, LinkedIn Ads, GA4, and Search Console MCP skills (v0.26.0).** Added a live X Ads operator plus dedicated Google Analytics and Search Console workflows, and upgraded the existing LinkedIn skill from export-first planning to live read/write operation. Registered the four sibling-server endpoints in `.mcp.json`, expanded cross-channel routing and approval guardrails, added reproducible live OAuth-discovery end-to-end coverage, and refreshed the public skill/integration catalog.

- **Cross-channel paid-ads skills (v0.25.11).** Added an evidence-first paid-media router plus guide, setup, integration, launch, review, optimization, creative, LinkedIn, TikTok, Amazon, and ChatGPT Ads workflows. Google and Meta requests route to the established NotFair operator skills; platforms without a declared NotFair MCP surface remain explicitly plan/review-only until a verified connector is available. Every workflow carries shared approval, measurement, and publication-status guardrails.

- **Evidence-based ads creative and assets (v0.25.10).** Added `/google-ads-assets` for reviewable extension, image-asset, and PMax production briefs, and `/meta-ads-creative` for grounded Facebook/Instagram concept slates and refresh tests. Both distinguish an approved brief from a published asset and keep unsupported claims, rights, and MCP capability boundaries explicit.

### Changed

- **Skills follow live capabilities (v0.27.4).** Removed fixed MCP tool catalogs, forced call sequences, assumed limits and rollback guarantees. Account-list requests stay scoped, and SEO uses existing connectors without mandatory gcloud setup.

- **Compact MCP migration completed (v0.27.3).** All plugin hosts use one `NotFair` connection at `https://notfair.co/api/mcp/notfair`. Skills now discover capabilities with `search` and use `executeRead` or `execute`, checking workspace platform access first. The registry workflow publishes only `server.json`; obsolete Google Ads and Meta Ads registry manifests are removed. The README and install guide include upgrade and reauthorization instructions. Older entries below describe historical releases, not current connection configuration.

- **Canonical all-platform MCP endpoint (v0.27.2).** Updated Cursor, Codex, Claude, Gemini, Agent Plugins, MCP Registry metadata, tests, and public documentation to advertise `https://notfair.co/api/mcp/notfair`. The backward-compatible legacy route remains supported but is no longer shown to new users.
- **One-command universal MCP onboarding (v0.27.0).** Replaced the six bundled platform server registrations with one `NotFair` MCP connection, now advertised at `https://notfair.co/api/mcp/notfair`. Codex and Claude now need one OAuth grant; workspaces enabled in the staged Google-first rollout connect Google Ads during that flow, and every supported platform remains isolated behind explicit tool prefixes such as `google_ads_`, `meta_ads_`, and `search_console_`.
- **Repository renamed to `nowork-studio/notfair-plugin`.** Active clone, install, update-check, package metadata, and source links now use the new GitHub repository name. The plugin name and `/notfair:*` command namespace remain unchanged.
- **`/google-ads-copy` now records concepts and claim sources,** requires unsupported proof to be marked for substantiation, and makes test decisions from pre-set metrics and adequate exposure rather than early conversion-rate gaps.

---

## [0.25.9] — 2026-07-21

### Fixed

- **`--no-open` is honored on macOS and Windows in the content-calendar viewer.** An operator-precedence bug in the auto-open guard meant the two platforms where auto-open actually fires never consulted the flag; the guard is now an explicit helper with unit tests. Contributed by @Osamaali313 (#92).

---

## [0.25.8] — 2026-07-21

### Added — ten new SEO skills (local, international, technical, commerce, off-page)

Major expansion of the SEO suite. All native skills built to repo conventions
(frontmatter triggers, `seo/shared/preamble.md` integration):

- **`local-seo`** — Local pack / Google Business Profile audit: NAP consistency,
  GBP completeness, review health, local & service-area pages, `LocalBusiness` schema.
- **`hreflang-international`** — Hreflang correctness (return tags, x-default,
  codes, hreflang↔canonical conflicts) + international URL-structure strategy.
- **`sitemap-audit`** — XML sitemap discovery, structural limits, lastmod accuracy,
  and a URL reality cross-check (non-200 / noindex / canonicalized-away listed).
- **`image-seo`** — Alt text, WebP/AVIF, compression, srcset, CLS width/height,
  lazy-load (incl. lazy-loaded-LCP), image sitemaps, `ImageObject` schema.
- **`ecommerce-seo`** — PLP/PDP, faceted-navigation crawl-budget traps, variant
  canonicals, out-of-stock handling, `Product`/`Offer`/`Review` schema.
- **`programmatic-seo`** — Templated pages at scale: demand validation, a
  uniqueness/value gate, internal-link hubs, indexation mgmt, doorway-page guardrails.
- **`competitor-pages`** — Coverage matrix + intent/depth/schema/E-E-A-T comparison
  vs. top-ranking URLs, producing a brief handable to `content-writer`.
- **`sxo`** — Search Experience Optimization: SERP click factors + post-click
  experience/conversion (above-the-fold intent match, CWV, CTAs, anti-pogo-sticking).
- **`seo-drift`** — Baseline + compare to catch regressions (lost rankings,
  deindexed pages, overwritten titles, flipped noindex/canonical).
- **`backlink-audit`** — Off-page audit from the free GSC Links report by default
  (or a paid Ahrefs/Semrush/DataForSEO export); explicit about data limits.

All registered in `AGENTS.md`, `.claude-plugin/plugin.json`,
`.claude-plugin/marketplace.json`, and `README.md`.

Skills that would duplicate existing skills were intentionally not added (to avoid
skill-routing collisions); the pure paid-data MCP wiring was skipped in favor of
`backlink-audit` consuming such data when present.

---

## [0.25.7] — 2026-07-14

### Changed

- Updated the public skill catalog to include the GSC-driven content planner and NotFair upgrade skill, and clarified that compatible coding agents can discover the host-agnostic skills through `AGENTS.md`.
- Brought the local NotFair app documentation in line with the shipped goal lifecycle, Codex account and model UI, platform selection, pull-request workflow, supported npm platform, and lowercase CLI commands.
- Documented the app's current trust boundaries accurately: Codex runs as trusted unsandboxed local automation, workflow and pull-request limits are behavioral guardrails, and OAuth credentials are not yet encrypted at the application layer.

---

## [0.25.6] — 2026-06-04

### Added

- Wired the NotFair Google Search Console MCP server (`https://notfair.co/api/mcp/google_search_console`) into the plugin's `.mcp.json`, exposing it as `NotFair-SearchConsole`. The hosted endpoint and the SEO connector were already live, but the plugin never registered the server, so its tools (search analytics, URL inspection, sitemaps) were unavailable in Claude Code alongside the existing Google Ads and Meta Ads servers.

---

## [0.25.5] — 2026-05-28

### Added

- Added Google Ads operator references for daily briefs, search-term triage, safe MCP execution, intervention memory, client reporting, local lead-gen accounts, and SaaS/B2B product-led accounts.
- Added Google Ads management evals covering daily operator briefs, safe search-term cleanup, failed mutation handling, and NotFair-style SaaS activation optimization.

### Changed

- Expanded Google Ads skills with repeatable optimization loops for search-term/n-gram triage, budget/rank diagnosis, broad match containment, RSA testing, landing-page message-chain testing, and conversion/network integrity checks.
- Updated `/google-ads` routing guidance to use the new daily operator, safe executor, intervention memory, and domain playbook references for recurring account-management workflows.

---

## [0.25.4] — 2026-05-28

### Changed

- Strengthened SEO content-quality guidance for compliance-sensitive claims, official-source citation requirements, internal links, and image asset validation.

---

## [0.25.3] — 2026-05-28

### Removed

- Removed the legacy OpenClaw adaptive layer, including repo-local orchestrator skills, cron/install scripts, schemas, examples, runtime helpers, and OpenClaw-specific tests.
- Removed the OpenClaw-backed `/notfair:cmo` launch skill from the Claude Code plugin manifest and public resolver.

### Changed

- Updated public install and resolver docs to describe the remaining host-agnostic NotFair skill surface for Claude Code, Codex, and Hermes.

---

## [0.25.2] — 2026-05-24

### Fixed

- **`/notfair:cmo` now self-updates.** The skill had no update-check preamble (unlike the google-ads / meta-ads / seo skills, which run `notfair-update-check` at Step 0). So a stale plugin ran stale instructions — e.g. probing the old port `3000` while the published CLI had moved to `3327`. Added a **Step 0** that runs `notfair-update-check` and, on `UPGRADE_AVAILABLE`, follows the `/notfair:upgrade` flow, then re-reads the refreshed skill before launching. Added `AskUserQuestion` to the skill's `allowed-tools` for the upgrade handoff.

---

## [0.25.1] — 2026-05-24

### Fixed

- **`notfair-cmo` standalone build now boots.** The published tarball crashed on launch with `Cannot find module 'bindings'` — `better-sqlite3`'s native loader was present in the pnpm store but not at a path Node could resolve. `scripts/copy-standalone-assets.mjs` now hoists `bindings` and `file-uri-to-path` into the standalone's top-level `node_modules/`.
- **`notfair-cmo` `package.json`** — corrected the `bin` path (`./bin/cli.mjs` → `bin/cli.mjs`, which npm 11 was stripping at publish), set first real release version `0.1.0`, and added an `os`/`cpu` guard (`darwin`/`arm64`) so unsupported platforms fail install cleanly instead of crashing at runtime.

### Changed

- **Portal default port moved `3000` → `3327`** (dev server stays on `3326`), avoiding the common `3000` collision and keeping dev/published ports adjacent. `/notfair:cmo` and the `notfair-cmo` CLI now use `3327`.
- **`next.config.ts`** — added `allowedDevOrigins: ["127.0.0.1"]` so the dev server hydrates when opened on the loopback IP.

---

## [0.25.0] — 2026-05-24

### Added

- **`notfair-cmo/`** — open-sourced the local CMO portal as a sibling project in this repo. Node app (Next.js) that runs on `http://127.0.0.1:3000`, orchestrates specialist marketing agents (CMO, Google Ads, SEO) per project, exposes chat + cron + activity log + MCP connections. Distributed via npm as `notfair-cmo`. Each project gets its own OpenClaw workspace under `~/.notfair-cmo/agents/`. Source: [`notfair-cmo/README.md`](notfair-cmo/README.md).
- **`/notfair:cmo`** — new slash command. Probes `http://127.0.0.1:3000`; if not running, runs `notfair-cmo doctor`, then `npx notfair-cmo@latest start` detached, then opens the browser. Supports a custom port (`/notfair:cmo --port 4001`). Source: [`notfair-cmo-skill/SKILL.md`](notfair-cmo-skill/SKILL.md).

The plugin and the CMO portal share the same skills engine but ship through different channels (Claude Code marketplace vs npm) and on independent release cadences. The plugin's `VERSION` and `notfair-cmo/package.json` version are intentionally decoupled.

---

## [0.24.0] — 2026-05-24

### ⚠️ Breaking — plugin renamed `toprank` → `notfair`

The Claude Code plugin name, slash-command prefix, and several internal
directories and binaries have been renamed from `toprank` to `notfair` to
align with the user-facing NotFair brand. This is a breaking change for
every installed user.

**You must uninstall the old plugin and reinstall under the new name:**

```
/plugin uninstall toprank@nowork-studio
/plugin marketplace add nowork-studio/notfair
/plugin install notfair@nowork-studio
```

After reinstall, every slash command moves from `/toprank:foo` →
`/notfair:foo` (e.g. `/notfair:google-ads-audit`, `/notfair:seo-analysis`).
The upgrade skill is now `/notfair:upgrade` (previously
`/toprank:toprank-upgrade`).

### Renamed

- **Plugin** — `name` in `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` and
  `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` is now `notfair` (previously `toprank`).
- **Skill directories** — `toprank-upgrade-skill/` →
  `notfair-upgrade-skill/`; `openclaw/skills/toprank-{site-onboard,
  portfolio-review,weekly-review,improve-page,investigate-drop}/` →
  `openclaw/skills/notfair-{...}/`.
- **Bin scripts** — `bin/toprank-{config,update-check,change-watch,
  content-calendar}` → `bin/notfair-{...}`. SessionStart hooks that ran the
  old path will need to be re-pointed.
- **Cron / launchd example** — `openclaw/install/toprank-openclaw.cron.example`
  → `notfair-openclaw.cron.example`.
- **Upgrade skill name** — frontmatter `name: toprank-upgrade` →
  `name: upgrade`; slash command consequently `/notfair:upgrade`.
- **Managed-block fence** — installers now write `<!-- notfair:managed -->`
  fences (previously `<!-- toprank:managed -->`). Re-running an installer
  against a file that has the old fence will create a second fence; users
  who want a fully clean state can delete the old block manually.
- **GitHub repository** — `nowork-studio/toprank` → `nowork-studio/notfair`
  (GitHub auto-redirects the old URL).

### Intentionally preserved (carve-outs)

The following paths and identifiers were **not** renamed in this release so
existing installs keep working without a migration step. A future release
may migrate them with proper backup logic.

- **`~/.toprank/` runtime state directory** — holds OpenClaw portfolio
  artifacts (`~/.toprank/openclaw/`), Google Ads change logs
  (`~/.toprank/ads/<account>/change-log.json`), SEO audit history
  (`~/.toprank/audit-log/<domain>.json`), business-context cache
  (`~/.toprank/business-context/<domain>.json`), and upgrade markers.
  Renaming this would orphan every existing user's accumulated data.
- **`TOPRANK_*` environment variables** — `TOPRANK_DIR`, `TOPRANK_STATE_DIR`,
  `TOPRANK_REMOTE_URL`, `TOPRANK_OPENCLAW_HOME`,
  `TOPRANK_VERCEL_PROTECTION_BYPASS`. These are internal testing /
  configuration overrides; renaming would silently break any user, cron job,
  or CI pipeline that sets them.
- **`com.noworkstudio.toprank.openclaw.scheduler` launchd label** —
  renaming would orphan the existing launchd job; the user would have to
  manually `launchctl unload` the old one.
- **`~/.toprank-evals/` test result store** — used only by the test suite.

### CHANGELOG history preserved verbatim

Past releases shipped under the `toprank` name and the historical record
reflects that. CHANGELOG entries below this one are unchanged.

### Out of scope (pre-existing)

- `meta-ads/manage/` and `meta-ads/audit/` do not ship `evals/evals.json`
  files. This gap predates 0.24.0 (introduced in 0.17.0). The renamed
  `test/install.test.sh` now enumerates all 18 skills correctly and surfaces
  the missing eval files as 2 failures; the prior test masked them by
  enumerating only 16 skills. A follow-up release should add the missing
  evals; this release does not change skill behavior.

### Migration footnotes

- **OpenClaw users** who ran `./openclaw/install/install-openclaw-cron.sh`
  on a prior release will have cron jobs named `Toprank OpenClaw Scheduler`
  and `Toprank Weekly Review — <site>`. After upgrading, re-running the
  install script will register new jobs named `NotFair ...` alongside the
  old `Toprank ...` ones. To clean up, run
  `openclaw cron remove "Toprank OpenClaw Scheduler"` and equivalent for
  each per-site weekly review job before re-installing.
- **Hooks pointing at `bin/toprank-change-watch`** in `~/.claude/settings.json`
  must be updated to `bin/notfair-change-watch` after reinstall.

---

## [0.23.0] — 2026-05-16

### Changed — full removal of legacy AdsAgent branding from active code

- The legacy AdsAgent brand is now fully removed from all **active** skill
  text, docs, MCP detection logic, install tests, and project guidance.
  CHANGELOG history is intentionally preserved verbatim — past releases
  shipped under that name and the historical record reflects that.
- **`google-ads/shared/preamble.md`** — dropped the one-time
  `.adsagent` → `.notfair` filesystem migration step entirely. Renumbered
  the remaining steps (Resolve config → Step 1, MCP detection → Step 2,
  Onboarding → Step 3, Calling tools → Step 4). MCP prefix detection now
  only looks for NotFair / NotFair-GoogleAds variants; the legacy
  `mcp__adsagent__*` / `mcp__claude_ai_AdsAgent__*` prefixes have been
  removed from the detection table, the legacy-prefix nudge, and the
  tool-call prefix reference list.
- **`gemini/SKILL.md`** — Step 2a (Google Ads change detection) no longer
  scans for the legacy MCP prefix or the legacy `.adsagent/` data-dir
  path.
- **`google-ads/shared/preamble.md`**, **`google-ads/shared/analysis-principles.md`**,
  **`google-ads/audit/SKILL.md`**, **`google-ads/manage/SKILL.md`** — the four
  active references to MCP playbook resources use `notfair://playbooks/*`
  rather than the prior `adsagent://` scheme.
- **`CLAUDE.md`** — "Branding: NotFair going forward" rewritten to
  "Branding: NotFair." The load-bearing-compat carve-out is gone (there
  is nothing left to carve out). The "Related repos" mention of the
  sibling `adsagent-plugin/` directory has been removed.
- **`README.md`** — Connectors table no longer mentions
  `mcp__adsagent__*` as a detected variant.
- **`test/install.test.sh`** — dropped the assertion that skills don't
  inline the legacy MCP prefix. The current assertion (no inline
  `mcp__notfair__listConnectedAccounts`) still guards against bypassing
  the shared preamble's prefix-detection logic.

### Coordination (shipped server-side in notfair `56d9106`)

- The `NotFair-GoogleAds` MCP server now dual-publishes the three
  playbook resources (`audit-account`, `explain-regression`,
  `run-experiment`) under both the canonical `notfair://` scheme and
  the legacy `adsagent://` scheme. New toprank (v0.23.0+) skills fetch
  via `notfair://`; pre-v0.23.0 toprank skills keep working via the
  legacy URI. The legacy server-side registration can be removed in a
  later release once telemetry confirms zero `resources/read` traffic
  under `adsagent://`.

### Breaking — pre-0.19 users without migrated config

- The auto-migration shipped in 0.15.0 (legacy `.adsagent` paths →
  `.notfair` paths) is gone. Users who first installed the plugin
  before 0.15.0 AND never invoked any google-ads skill on a
  0.15.x–0.22.x version will, on upgrade to 0.23.0, find their saved
  `accountId` and data files invisible to the plugin. Resolution:
  rename the legacy global directory (`~/.adsagent` → `~/.notfair`),
  the legacy project config file (`.adsagent.json` → `.notfair.json`),
  and the legacy project data dir if any (`.adsagent/` → `.notfair/`)
  manually, or simply re-run the `/google-ads` onboarding to save a
  fresh `accountId`. One-time-per-machine fix.

---

## [0.22.0] — 2026-05-15

### Added — opt-in OpenClaw cron publisher

- **`openclaw/bin/publish_pending.py`** — stdlib Python publisher. Reads
  `content-calendar.json`, finds entries with `status: "ready_to_publish"`
  and a `bodyPath`, POSTs each to `$NOTFAIR_PUBLISH_URL` (default:
  `https://notfair.co/api/blog/publish`) with `Authorization: Bearer
  $NOTFAIR_PUBLISH_TOKEN`. Dry-run by default — needs `--commit` (or
  `OPENCLAW_PUBLISH_COMMIT=1`) to actually fire. Response handling:
  2xx → `published` with stored URL; 4xx → `failed` (non-retryable);
  5xx / network error → entry stays `ready_to_publish`, exits non-zero so
  the next cron pass retries.
- **`openclaw/install/install-openclaw-cron.sh --enable-publisher`** — new
  opt-in flag that registers a recurring `Toprank NotFair Publisher` cron
  job via `openclaw cron add`. Default interval: 15m (override with
  `--publisher-every`). Existing installs are unaffected — without the
  flag, the publisher is not registered.
- **`openclaw/install/notfair-publisher.md`** — webhook contract for the
  Next.js side: endpoint, auth, request payload shape, expected
  responses, idempotency, status-code semantics, versioning. Single source
  of truth — keep `publish_pending.py` and the Next.js handler in lockstep
  via this doc.
- **`seo/content-planner/SKILL.md`** — schema now documents
  `ready_to_publish` / `published` / `failed` statuses and `bodyPath`,
  `featuredImage`, `inlineImages`, `structuredData`, `metaDescription`
  fields. Includes a status-lifecycle table. The planner never
  auto-promotes — the hand-flip to `ready_to_publish` is the user's
  explicit go-ahead.
- **15 unit tests** (`openclaw/tests/test_publish_pending.py`) covering
  missing calendar, no ready entries, missing token, dry-run, 2xx /
  4xx / 5xx / network, missing body file, multiple entries, site filter,
  payload shape, and CLI/env-var precedence.

### Changed — opt-in carve-out, not policy flip

- **`openclaw/README.md`** "What it is not" — narrowed from "not a
  production auto-publisher" (absolute) to "not an auto-publisher by
  default" (opt-in carve-out). Existing installs stay read-only /
  advisory; users explicitly opt in with `--enable-publisher`.

### Notes — what's intentionally NOT here

- No dependency on `gbrain` (Garry Tan's open-source memory/scheduler
  runtime). It's a real and capable project, but for a stateless
  POST-on-a-timer the marginal value over `openclaw cron` is zero and the
  dependency surface is large. The publisher is runtime-agnostic stdlib
  Python — if someone later wants to drive it from gbrain or plain
  crontab, they wire up a one-line shell job pointing at
  `publish_pending.py`.
- No HMAC signing in v1. Add `X-NotFair-Signature` and bump
  `schemaVersion` if needed.

---

## [0.21.0] — 2026-05-15

### Added — `/content-planner` skill + local calendar viewer
- **New skill: `seo/content-planner`.** A GSC-driven content calendar. Pulls
  90 days of Search Console query × page data, classifies every (query, page)
  row into one of five buckets (striking-distance positions 5–20,
  unanswered-intent gaps, CTR underperformers, related-keyword expansions, and
  cannibalization warnings), computes a click-potential score per topic
  (`projectedImpressions × (targetCtrAtPosition3 − currentCtr)`), and writes
  a dated, prioritized calendar to `{data_dir}/content-calendar.json`.
  Refuses to ship the calendar when GSC isn't connected, when there's < 50
  rows of data to reason about, or when two scheduled topics share a primary
  keyword. Hands off to `/content-writer`, `/meta-tags-optimizer`, and
  `/seo-analysis` based on bucket.
- **New binary: `bin/toprank-content-calendar`.** Stdlib-only Python HTTP
  server that reads `content-calendar.json` and renders a read-only calendar
  view on `localhost:8323` (configurable). Auto-discovers the calendar at
  `./.notfair/content-calendar.json` then `~/.notfair/content-calendar.json`,
  falls forward through the next 9 ports if the default is in use, exits
  cleanly on Ctrl+C. No pip install, no framework, no auth — loopback-only.
- **Methodology reference: `seo/content-planner/references/planning-methodology.md`.**
  Codifies the CTR-by-position curve, the five-bucket classification rubric,
  the click-potential formula with seasonality factors, scheduling rules
  (one post per week by default, P0s first, refreshes parallel to new posts),
  and explicit failure modes (calendar padding, intent mismatch, treating GSC
  impressions as third-party volume).

### Changed — boundary cleanup against `/keyword-research`
- `/keyword-research` description now scopes it explicitly to seed-driven
  keyword discovery and points users at `/content-planner` for editorial
  calendars built from their own GSC data. AGENTS.md row updated to match.

### Notes
- The calendar viewer is read-only by design — editing happens in the JSON
  file, the viewer re-reads on every request. Loop: edit JSON → reload page.
- The viewer auto-opens the browser on macOS/Windows and on Linux with
  `$DISPLAY` set; pass `--no-open` to disable.

---

## [0.20.0] — 2026-05-15

### Changed — `/content-writer` blog-post bar raised
- **Hook-driven titles are now required.** The reference now ships four working
  title-hook patterns (number + specificity, audience-named guide, contrarian
  myth-break, outcome promise + proof) with examples and an explicit disqualifier
  list. Bare-keyword titles ("Facebook SEO Optimization") no longer pass the
  quality gate.
- **Images are now a hard requirement, not a "should-have".** Every blog post
  ships with a featured/thumbnail image plus ≥ 3 inline images placed at
  meaningful points (diagram, screenshot, comparison, data viz — decorative stock
  fails the gate). The skill instructs the agent to generate images in the same
  pass: use host-native image gen (Codex `gpt-image`, Gemini Imagen) when
  available, fall back to NotFair MCP `generate_image`, otherwise emit detailed
  prompts so the user can run them in their own tool. Image SEO rules (file
  naming, alt text, format, lazy-loading) are now codified.
- **Table of contents is required at the top of every blog post.** Anchor links
  to every H2, regardless of length — the prior > 1500-word threshold is gone.
- **Minimum length: 1000 words of substantive body content.** Anything shorter
  reads like AI filler and doesn't earn the click.
- **Editorial bar referenced explicitly.** `SKILL.md` now points at NotFair's
  own [`facebook-seo-optimization`](https://notfair.co/blog/facebook-seo-optimization)
  post as the quality benchmark for tone, depth, and structure.

### Changed — `/google-ads*` MCP-not-detected prompt now leads with a clear NotFair connect CTA
- The "no MCP server detected" branch in `google-ads/shared/preamble.md` used
  to open with a troubleshooting sentence. It now opens with **"Connect to
  NotFair to manage Google Ads"** and presents a three-step connect flow
  (`/mcp` → sign in → re-run request) before the OAuth-refresh and Google-
  official-MCP fallback notes. New users now see a clear action, not a
  diagnostic.

### Notes
- No file moves, no skill renames, no breaking changes — `toprank` remains the
  plugin / package name, NotFair remains the user-facing brand per `CLAUDE.md`.
- Existing posts written under the 0.19.x bar still work; the new requirements
  apply to fresh content.

---

## [0.19.0] — 2026-05-14

### Added — multi-host support
- **`AGENTS.md` at the repo root** — universal skill resolver. Maps user intents (SEO audit, ad copy, traffic drop, landing page audit, etc.) to the right `SKILL.md` for every supported agent host. Read natively by Codex; read by OpenClaw, Hermes, Cursor, and any agent following `INSTALL_FOR_AGENTS.md`. Claude Code continues to use `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` as before — `AGENTS.md` is additive, not a replacement.
- **`INSTALL_FOR_AGENTS.md` at the repo root** — single paste-URL install entry point. The user pastes one line into their agent; the agent detects the host (Claude Code / OpenClaw / Codex / Hermes / generic) and follows the matching install branch.
- **`install/README.md`** — convention for adding future per-host install adapters without duplicating skills. Documents the managed-block fence rule (`<!-- toprank:managed -->`) so installers that write to user-edited config files stay idempotent and preserve hand-edits.

### Changed
- **`CLAUDE.md`** reframed from "Claude Code plugin" to "host-agnostic plugin." Adding a new skill now requires registering it in **both** `AGENTS.md` and `.claude-plugin/plugin.json`.
- **`CLAUDE.md` branding rule** — added an explicit "NotFair going forward" section. New user-facing text and docs must use NotFair. Existing legacy `adsagent` references are kept only where they are load-bearing (filesystem migration, prefix detection during the rename window) or historical (CHANGELOG).

### Removed
- **Stale "server source" link from `README.md`.** The link previously pointed to `nowork-studio/ads-agent` (404) and the actual server source is not public. Removed the pointer entirely — the surrounding paragraph already covers what Toprank users need (endpoint URL, registry name, OAuth flow).

### Notes
- No skill behavior changes. All canonical SEO, Google Ads, Meta Ads, and Gemini skills work identically to 0.18.0.
- OpenClaw multi-site orchestrators under `openclaw/skills/` are unchanged; they're now explicitly tagged as OpenClaw-only in `AGENTS.md`.

---

## [0.18.0] — 2026-05-09

### Changed
- **Google Ads skills are now less prescriptive and more evidence-driven.** All four `/google-ads*` skills (`manage`, `audit`, `copy`, `landing`) have been rewritten to lean on the agent's diagnostic judgment instead of step-by-step decision trees. The skills now require every recommendation to cite specific data from the user's account — entity name, dollar amount, time window — and refuse to fall back on generic "industry typical" claims.
- **New shared analysis principles.** Added `google-ads/shared/analysis-principles.md` covering the universal evidence requirement, the high-level approach, and the non-negotiable guardrails (STOP on broken conversion tracking, never pause Tier 1 keywords on short windows, statistical significance gate, server-side limits, undo window, bulk-write confirmation). Every Google Ads skill now reads this on entry alongside `preamble.md`.
- **Audit no longer emits a 0–5 rubric score.** `/google-ads-audit` now produces three **pulse metrics** — Waste ($/mo), Demand captured (%), CPA ($) — each annotated with its top contributor and a pointer to the fix. The metric IS the verdict; no letter grades, no opaque numerical scores. The seven diagnostic areas remain as the surface area you look across to back the pulse metrics; the rigid scoring math is gone.
- **Trimmed the most prescriptive references.** `manage/references/analysis-heuristics.md`, `manage/references/quality-score-framework.md`, and `audit/references/account-health-scoring.md` all drop the prescriptive "if condition X → action Y" threshold tables and keep the genuinely load-bearing material: signal-quality red flags, keyword tier classification (Tier 1 guardrail), statistical-significance gate, brand-leakage / weighted-QS / counting-type / Display+Search domain facts, the impression-share interpretive matrix, the wasted-spend formula with de-duplication, brand vs. non-brand framing, the pulse-metrics output spec, and industry CPA calibration anchors.

### Added — tool-surface guidance for newer MCP capabilities
- **Experiments framework** — `/google-ads-copy` now points A/B work at `createAdVariationExperiment` (and the broader `createExperiment` / `addExperimentArms` / `scheduleExperiment` / `graduateExperiment` / `promoteExperiment` flow) instead of the old "deploy two paused ads side by side" pattern.
- **Change observability and interventions** — `/google-ads` surfaces `listChangeInterventions`, `getChangeIntervention`, `evaluateChangeIntervention`, `getChanges`, and `reviewChangeImpact` as first-class tools alongside `undoChange`.
- **Shared negative keyword lists, portfolio bidding strategies, asset management (callout / sitelink / structured snippet / image — create + link + unlink), all campaign-creation types (PMax / Shopping / Video / Demand Gen / Display / App), PMax asset-group controls, offline conversion uploads (`uploadClickConversions`), tracking templates, server-side guardrails (`getGuardrails` / `setGuardrails`), and `summarizeAccountSetup`** are now categorically named in `manage/SKILL.md`'s tool-surface section so the agent knows the capabilities exist without enumerating every individual tool.

---

## [0.17.0]

### Added
- **New skills: `/meta-ads` and `/meta-ads-audit`** — Meta Ads (Facebook + Instagram) operate / diagnose / audit skills. `/meta-ads` is the analytical brain layered on top of the NotFair-MetaAds MCP server: it covers performance and ROAS analysis, creative fatigue diagnosis, Learning Phase / Learning Limited triage, audience overlap and lookalike strategy, CBO/ABO/Advantage+ Shopping campaign structure, and the dedicated mutations the Meta MCP exposes (`pauseCampaign`/`pauseAdSet`/`pauseAd`, `enable*`, `updateCampaignBudget`, `updateAdSetBudget`, `renameCampaign`). `/meta-ads-audit` is the read-only health check — 7 dimensions scored 0–5 (Pixel + CAPI Health, Attribution & Measurement, Campaign Structure, Creative Health, Audience Strategy, Spend Efficiency, Scaling Readiness) — and persists `meta/business-context.json` + `meta/personas/{accountId}.json` for downstream skills. Skills follow the existing `google-ads/` template (`manage/`, `audit/`, `shared/`) and reuse the same `.notfair.json` config file via a new `metaAccountId` field. **Intentionally scoped:** `/meta-ads-copy` and `/meta-ads-landing` are not shipped in this release — Meta's creative-led, no-Quality-Score reality means those skills warrant Meta-native designs rather than literal mirrors of the Google Ads versions.
- **MCP server: `NotFair-MetaAds`** — added to `.mcp.json` (`https://notfair.co/api/mcp/meta_ads`). Same OAuth 2.1 / native HTTP transport as `NotFair-GoogleAds`. Existing OAuth tokens for NotFair apply; restart Claude Code after upgrading to pick up the new server.
- **`meta-ads/shared/`** — preamble (MCP detection + onboarding for `metaAccountId`), `policy-registry.json` (Meta-specific assumptions: CBO/ABO, Learning Phase 50-in-7, attribution defaults, frequency thresholds, ASC, AEM/CAPI), and `meta-math.md` (CPM, link CTR, hook rate, frequency, Break-Even ROAS, MER, budget-forecasting respecting the 20% rule that resets Meta Learning Phase).
- **OpenClaw adaptive layer (working MVP).** Added a new `openclaw/` repo surface that wraps the existing Toprank SEO skills for OpenClaw without duplicating them. The MVP includes multi-site portfolio docs, per-site work-folder conventions, wrapper skills (`toprank-site-onboard`, `toprank-portfolio-review`, `toprank-weekly-review`, `toprank-improve-page`, `toprank-investigate-drop`), JSON artifact schemas, helper scripts to bootstrap a portfolio and per-site workspace, onboarding persistence, weekly-review run persistence, portfolio review ranking, page-improvement persistence, drop-investigation persistence, follow-up discovery, a simple scheduler runner that processes due `feedback_check` items and surfaces manual-attention work, automatic baseline snapshot inheritance for feedback queue items, a first-pass feedback scorer that classifies follow-ups as `win`, `neutral`, `loss`, or `inconclusive` from before/after metric snapshots, learned-prior updates in `learned-patterns.json`, and a helper to hydrate observed metrics from real Google Search Console data.

---

## [0.16.0] — 2026-04-30

### Changed (breaking)
- **Google Ads slash commands renamed.** `/ads` → `/google-ads`, `/ads-audit` → `/google-ads-audit`, `/ads-copy` → `/google-ads-copy`, `/ads-landing` → `/google-ads-landing`. Disambiguates the namespace ahead of future Meta Ads / LinkedIn Ads skills. Update saved prompts, Coworker tasks, and any scripts that invoke the old names.
- **Skill folder layout reorganized.** Inside `google-ads/`, sub-folders are now platform-agnostic short names (`manage/`, `audit/`, `copy/`, `landing/`) — the platform context lives in the parent dir, not duplicated in every child. Skill `name:` frontmatter carries the fully-qualified slash command (e.g. `name: google-ads-audit`). New ad platforms will follow the same template (`meta-ads/{manage,audit,copy,...}`).
- **MCP server renamed to NotFair-GoogleAds.** `server.json` `title` is now `NotFair-GoogleAds` and the streamable-HTTP endpoint moved from `https://notfair.co/api/mcp` to `https://notfair.co/api/mcp/google_ads`, namespacing the route ahead of future per-platform MCP endpoints. The plugin's `.mcp.json` is updated automatically on upgrade; existing OAuth tokens still apply.

---

## [0.15.2] — 2026-04-29

### Changed
- **Branding cleanup across the public plugin surface.** Updated Toprank's README, marketplace metadata, plugin metadata, eval prompts, and Google Ads skill copy to present the product as NotFair / `notfair.co` instead of the old AdsAgent branding where the references were still user-facing. Kept intentional legacy migration notes and technical compatibility references (`.adsagent`, `mcp__adsagent__*`, `adsagent://playbooks/...`) intact where they still describe real compatibility behavior.

---

## [0.15.1] — 2026-04-28

### Changed
- **`google-ads/shared/preamble.md` — Step 4 zero-account guidance.** Updated the onboarding instructions for users whose Google identity has no accessible Google Ads customer (`listConnectedAccounts` returns an empty list / `noAccount: true`). The previous copy directed them to a static "connect at notfair.co" link; the new flow is a self-contained recovery loop driven from inside Claude — Claude tells the user to create a Google Ads account at https://ads.google.com (Smart Mode is the fastest path; payment method optional), then calls the new `refreshAccounts` MCP tool to detect the account without re-authentication. Includes propagation guidance for the 1-2 minute delay between Google account creation and the customer record becoming queryable. Pairs with the NotFair server-side change that ships an MCP bearer token even for no-account sessions, so the Claude Desktop OAuth handshake completes instead of dead-ending in a hung browser tab.

---

## [0.15.0] — 2026-04-28

### Changed
- **MCP server moved from AdsAgent to NotFair** — endpoint migrated from `https://adsagent.org/api/mcp` to `https://notfair.co/api/mcp`. The plugin's `.mcp.json` is updated automatically when you upgrade; restart Claude Code to pick up the new server.
- **Auth scheme switched from API key to native OAuth 2.1** — `ADSAGENT_API_KEY` is no longer required, and the `mcp-remote` (npx) bridge has been removed. `.mcp.json` now uses Claude Code's native HTTP transport (`"type": "http"`); on first connection Claude Code opens a browser tab for OAuth sign-in to NotFair and stores the token in your OS keychain. You can remove `ADSAGENT_API_KEY` from `~/.claude/settings.json` once the new server is connected.
- **Local namespace renamed `.adsagent` → `.notfair`** — affects the global config dir (`~/.adsagent/` → `~/.notfair/`), the project config file (`.adsagent.json` → `.notfair.json`), and the project data dir (`.adsagent/` → `.notfair/`). The shared preamble runs a one-time atomic `mv` migration on first invocation; if both old and new paths exist (partial state from a manual move), it stops and asks you to reconcile rather than risk losing writes. **Update your `.gitignore` if you were ignoring `.adsagent.json` / `.adsagent/`.**
- **Tool prefix renamed `mcp__adsagent__*` → `mcp__notfair__*`** — driven by the `.mcp.json` server-name change. The shared preamble's MCP detection prefers the new prefix but still detects the legacy one (and the legacy `mcp__claude_ai_AdsAgent__*` connector) so skills keep working through the rename window. If you're on a session that hasn't restarted yet, the preamble nudges you to restart Claude Code once.
- **MCP registry identifier renamed `io.github.nowork-studio/adsagent` → `io.github.nowork-studio/notfair`** — for users who consume the standalone MCP server directly (Claude Desktop, Cursor, Inspector, custom agents). Bumped the published server version to 0.3.0 to reflect the rename.

### Migration notes
- The shared preamble handles `.adsagent` → `.notfair` filesystem migration automatically — no manual steps for global users.
- Users who ran "save this account for this project only" will have their project-level config (`.adsagent.json` and the `.adsagent/` data dir) renamed in place on next skill invocation.
- OAuth tokens are stored in the OS keychain (Keychain on macOS, Credential Manager on Windows, Secret Service on Linux). On first connection to the new endpoint you'll see a browser tab for sign-in; tokens refresh automatically afterwards.

---

## [0.14.0] — 2026-04-27

### Added
- **New Skill: `geo-optimizer`** — Generative Engine Optimization for AI search engines (ChatGPT, Claude, Perplexity, Gemini, Google AI Overviews). Three modes: **audit** (score content on the GEO Signal Stack with a 0–100 GEO Score across Evidence Density / Structure & Position / Authority Signals / AI Crawlability), **optimize** (rewrite content applying real-evidence patterns derived from the Princeton GEO paper, KDD 2024, and CMU AutoGEO, ICLR 2026), and **strategy** (30/60/90-day per-engine playbook). Distinct from the existing `content-writer` skill — content-writer optimizes for Google's blue-link rankings, geo-optimizer optimizes for AI citation. Includes a comprehensive `references/geo-techniques.md` covering PAWC front-loading, evidence density targets, per-engine playbooks (each engine has a different citation profile — ChatGPT cites Wikipedia ~48%, Perplexity weights freshness, Gemini leans Reddit, Claude weights primary sources), AI crawler robots.txt configuration, and measurement patterns aligned with `gego` and `llmopt` open-source trackers. **Hard rule: no fabricated stats, quotes, or citations** — ships an Evidence Hunt workflow that requires real, verifiable sources before any rewrite.

---

## [0.13.2] — 2026-04-26

### Added
- **New SEO Skill: `broken-link-checker`** — Scans websites to find broken internal and external links (404s, 5xx errors). Provides a detailed report with source pages and status codes.
- **`CONTRIBUTING.md`** — A guide for community contributors on how to add new skills, fix bugs, and follow the project's quality standards.

---

## [0.13.1] — 2026-04-25

### Fixed
- **Windows portability** — replaced POSIX-only `os.getuid()` with a portable `_uid.portable_uid()` helper across the seo-analysis scripts (`pagespeed.py`, `analyze_gsc.py`, `list_gsc_sites.py`, `url_inspection.py`, `show_gsc.py`, `show_pagespeed.py`, all four `fetch_*_content.py` CMS connectors) and the `SKILL.md` CMS heredoc. Native CPython on Windows has no `os.getuid()`, which crashed the entire SEO analysis flow with `AttributeError`. Reported in #44 — thanks @seo4pymesjesus-ux. The new helper returns the same numeric uid on POSIX (preserving existing tmp filenames) and falls back to a sanitized username on Windows.

### Security
- **Hardened tmp-file writes against symlink attacks.** `pagespeed.py`, `analyze_gsc.py`, `list_gsc_sites.py`, and `url_inspection.py` previously wrote results to predictable paths in the system tempdir using direct `open(path, "w")` — exploitable on shared `/tmp` by pre-creating the destination as a symlink. They now use `_uid.secure_write_json()`, which writes via `tempfile.mkstemp()` + `chmod 0600` + atomic `os.replace()` (the same pattern the CMS fetchers already used). Files are also now created with mode 0600 instead of the umask default, preventing other users on shared hosts from reading cached GSC analytics or CMS content.
- **Sanitize Windows username** before interpolating into a tmp path, defending against env-var-driven path traversal in privilege-separation contexts.

### Internal
- **Repaired the unit test suite.** `test/unit/test_analyze_gsc.py`, `test_cms_scripts.py`, `test_strapi_scripts.py`, and `test_url_inspection.py` referenced a `skills/seo-analysis/scripts/` path that no longer exists (the directory was renamed to `seo/seo-analysis/scripts/`). The tests had been failing to even collect. Paths corrected and the loaders now insert the scripts directory into `sys.path` so `from _uid import …` resolves under `importlib.util.spec_from_file_location`. 255 unit tests pass.

---

## [0.13.0] — 2026-04-24

### Changed
- **Realigned google-ads skills with the new MCP server surface.** The AdsAgent MCP server consolidated read-only tools behind `runScript` (a JS sandbox exposing `ads.gaql()` and `ads.gaqlParallel()`), retired the per-surface helpers (`listCampaigns`, `getKeywords`, `getSearchTermReport`, `getCampaignPerformance`, `getImpressionShare`, `runGaqlQuery`, `getAccountInfo`, `getCampaignSettings`, `listAds`, `listAdGroups`, etc.), and removed the bespoke `audit()` tool. Skills referenced those tools by name in workflow tables, reference docs, and SKILL bodies — guidance that no longer applied.
- **Relaxed the prescriptive style.** Skills now provide frameworks, scoring rubrics, benchmarks, business-context schemas, and operational discipline — not step-by-step "call X then Y" choreography. Tool routing is delegated to the server's own MCP instructions, which already tell the agent to fan out reads through `runScript` + `gaqlParallel` and route mutations through dedicated write tools. The agent does the heavy lifting; the skill supplies the judgment.
- **`ads/SKILL.md`** — dropped the "Available Tools" enumeration and the prescriptive "Performance Summary / Waste Audit / …" workflow playbooks. Kept operating principles, the reference-routing table, the account-baseline contract, change-tracking discipline, and conditional handoffs.
- **`ads-audit/SKILL.md`** — replaced the now-removed `audit(accountId, days=30)` payload contract with a description of the GAQL surfaces a complete audit needs (customer, campaign, ad_group, keyword_view, search_term_view, conversion_action, ad_group_ad, campaign_criterion for geo, change_event). The agent assembles the dataset via one `runScript` + `gaqlParallel` call, optionally seeded by the server's `adsagent://playbooks/audit-account` MCP resource. Kept the 7-dimension scoring rubric, business-context and persona schemas + filesystem contract, encoded heuristics, and the impression-share interpretation matrix.
- **`ads-copy/SKILL.md`** and **`ads-landing/SKILL.md`** — replaced helper-tool sequences ("call `listAds`, then `getKeywords`, then …") with GAQL surface descriptions the agent can fan out in one `runScript` call.
- **`shared/preamble.md`** — Step 5 now describes the read/write split (runScript for reads, dedicated tools for mutations) and points at the server's playbook resources, instead of pushing `runGaqlQuery` against a 50-row limit.
- **`ads/references/session-checks.md`**, **`ads-audit/references/persona-discovery.md`**, **`ads-audit/references/business-context.md`**, **`ads-audit/references/account-health-scoring.md`** — scrubbed dead tool names; persona discovery and the audit website-resolution step now reference GAQL surfaces directly.

### Removed
- **`ads/references/workflow-playbooks.md`** — the server now ships `adsagent://playbooks/audit-account` and `adsagent://playbooks/explain-regression` as MCP resources covering the same ground; maintaining a parallel skill-side copy guarantees drift.
- **`shared/gaql-cookbook.md`** — built around `runGaqlQuery`'s 50-row limit, which no longer applies. The server's own MCP instructions already teach the `gaqlParallel` fan-out pattern with worked examples.

---

## [0.12.1] — 2026-04-22

### Changed
- Added explicit AdsAgent attribution in README and plugin metadata (no functional changes; plugin name and skill IDs unchanged).

---

## [0.12.0] — 2026-04-19

### Changed
- **ads-audit SKILL.md slimmed from ~600 to ~140 lines** — Stripped phase-by-phase narrative, report markdown templates, output-discipline rules, per-dimension prose, and the conditional-handoff table. Modern models handle structure and formatting on their own; the skill no longer needs to spell that out.
- **Kept the durable encoded judgment** — Audit response shape, field→dimension scoring map, 0–5 score rubric, Impression Share Interpretation Matrix, the agency-earned heuristics (weighted QS by spend, brand leakage 5–10× CPA premium, waste formula, Display+Search mixing, STOP condition on conversion tracking), policy freshness check, and the filesystem contract (`business-context.json` + `personas/{accountId}.json` schemas).
- **Tightened guardrails** — Explicit "read-only skill, mutations go through `/ads`" rule at top and bottom; STOP condition for broken conversion tracking; mandate to always persist business-context and personas even on short reports.

---

## [0.11.4] — 2026-04-15

### Fixed
- **Google Ads MCP detection on Claude Desktop plugin** — When connected through the claude.ai plugin connector, the AdsAgent MCP server is exposed as `mcp__claude_ai_AdsAgent__*` instead of `mcp__adsagent__*`. The shared preamble only recognized the Claude Code CLI prefix, so ads-audit and other google-ads skills incorrectly reported "MCP not connected" and refused to run. Detection now scans the available tool list for any `*listConnectedAccounts` tool, extracts the prefix, and uses that prefix for all subsequent tool calls. Supports Claude Code CLI, Claude Desktop, and any future host using an AdsAgent variant.

### Changed
- **Consistent tool references across google-ads skills** — `ads-copy/SKILL.md` had hardcoded `mcp__adsagent__` prefixes on tool references (`createAd`, `updateAdAssets`, `enableAd`, `undoChange`, `listAds`, `pauseAd`, `listCampaigns`, `listAdGroups`). Stripped to bare tool names to match `ads`, `ads-audit`, and `ads-landing`, which already used bare names. Skills now uniformly defer to the preamble for prefix resolution.

---

## [0.11.3] — 2026-04-12

### Added
- **Change impact review mode** — Users can now say "check my changes" or "did my changes work" to review the impact of recent Google Ads changes. The ads skill routes these requests through session-checks with proper before/after metric comparison
- **Maturation guidance** — When changes haven't had enough time to accumulate data (7 days for bid/keyword changes, 14 days for structural changes), the skill explains why and tells the user when to check back instead of showing misleading early metrics

### Changed
- **Deduped headline/description formulas** — Removed 50-line inline formula table from ads-copy SKILL.md; now references `rsa-best-practices.md` as single source of truth
- **Deduped business context intake** — Removed 75-line duplicate intake procedure from ads-copy SKILL.md; now references `ads-audit/references/business-context.md` as canonical source
- **Fixed session-checks query logic** — Changed from filtering only matured entries to finding all unreviewed entries, then branching on maturation status. Previously the "still maturing" message could never fire
- **Removed overly generic triggers** — Dropped "did it improve" and "what happened after" which could false-positive on non-ads queries

---

## [0.11.2] — 2026-04-11

### Changed
- **Ads skill SKILL.md slimmed down** — Extracted analysis heuristics, change tracking, session checks, and workflow playbooks into dedicated reference files under `google-ads/ads/references/`. Main SKILL.md went from ~770 lines to ~160 lines, loading references on demand instead of carrying everything inline
- **New reference routing table** — SKILL.md now has a quick-lookup table mapping situations (performance analysis, QS diagnostics, bid strategy, etc.) to the right reference file
- **Added new MCP tools** — Listed `getKeywordIdeas`, `getPmaxAssetGroups`, `getPmaxAssets`, `searchGeoTargets`, `updateCampaignBidding`, `updateCampaignGoals`, `removeAd`, `pausePmaxAssetGroup`, `enablePmaxAssetGroup` in the tool catalog
- **Two interaction modes** — SKILL.md now distinguishes direct actions (fast path, no session checks) from analysis requests (full checks and reporting)
- **Dev symlink detection** — `bin/toprank-update-check` and the upgrade skill now detect dev symlinks and skip update checks, preventing upgrade attempts on developer-managed installs

---

## [0.11.1] — 2026-04-11

### Changed
- **Ads audit restructured around 5 analysis layers and 3 actionable passes** — Replaced the 7-dimension scoring model (0-5 per dimension, 0-100 composite) with a layered analysis approach: Signals → Relevance → Efficiency → Scale → Growth. Findings now map to 3 action-oriented passes: Stop Wasting, Capture More, Fix Fundamentals. Tracks 3 objective pulse metrics (waste rate, demand captured, CPA) with trend comparison on re-audits
- **Added PMax campaign support** — Asset group completeness checks, PMax cannibalization detection for brand Search traffic, and PMax-specific bid strategy guidance
- **Added audience signals check** — Flags Search campaigns missing audience segments and PMax asset groups without audience signals, both of which limit Smart Bidding performance
- **Smarter waste calculation** — Keyword waste threshold changed from "clicks > 10" to "spend > 2x account average CPA", which respects Smart Bidding's learning curve. Added de-duplication rules to prevent double-counting between keyword and search term waste
- **On-demand reference loading** — Quality score, search term analysis, industry benchmarks, and campaign structure references now load only when relevant issues are detected, saving ~1,000 lines of context per audit
- **Extracted reference docs** — Persona discovery template and business context crawl procedure moved to dedicated reference files for reuse across skills

---

## [0.11.0] — 2026-04-09

### Added
- **Gemini cross-model review skill** — New `/toprank:gemini` skill that launches Google's Gemini CLI as an independent reviewer. Three modes: review (pass/fail gate), challenge (adversarial stress test), and consult (open Q&A). Unlike code-only review tools, handles Google Ads changes (campaign structure, bid strategies, keywords) and SEO metadata changes (title tags, meta descriptions, schema markup) alongside code diffs. Produces cross-model analysis when Claude has already reviewed the same changes, highlighting overlapping findings, unique catches, and disagreements.

---

## [0.10.0.1] — 2026-04-08

### Changed
- **Consolidated root files** — Merged `CONNECTORS.md` and `CONTRIBUTING.md` into `README.md` to reduce file count without losing content. Connectors section now lives under "## Connectors" and contributing guide under "## Contributing" in the main README.
- **Updated install test** — Test suite now checks for connector content in `README.md` instead of the removed `CONNECTORS.md` file.
- **Added `seo-page` to directory tree** in README to reflect the new single-page analysis skill.

### Removed
- **`CONNECTORS.md`** — Content moved to README.md.
- **`CONTRIBUTING.md`** — Content moved to README.md.
- **`requirements-test.lock`** — Stale lock file that didn't match `requirements-test.txt`.

---

## [0.10.0] — 2026-04-08

### Added
- **PageSpeed Insights API integration** — New `pagespeed.py` script calls the Google PageSpeed Insights API for multiple URLs with concurrent execution. Collects Lighthouse performance scores, Core Web Vitals (LCP, INP, CLS, FCP, TTFB), CrUX field data, optimization opportunities, and diagnostics. Supports both mobile and desktop strategies.
- **PageSpeed display script** — New `show_pagespeed.py` renders PageSpeed results in a terminal-friendly format with scores, metrics, opportunities, and diagnostics.
- **Phase 5.5 in SEO analysis** — PageSpeed analysis runs in parallel alongside URL Inspection and CMS detection during audits. Results feed into the report with a dedicated "PageSpeed & Core Web Vitals" section and are logged in the audit history for tracking performance over time.
- **Preflight PageSpeed checks** — `preflight.py` now auto-enables the PageSpeed Insights API and checks for a `PAGESPEED_API_KEY` in the environment or `~/.toprank/.env`.

---

## [0.9.9] — 2026-04-08

### Changed
- **API key check moved to shared preamble** — Moved the `ADSAGENT_API_KEY` verification from the `/ads` skill into the shared preamble so all google-ads skills (`/ads`, `/ads-audit`, `/ads-copy`) verify the key automatically. The key is saved to `~/.claude/settings.json` under `env` (not config files) since the MCP server reads it from the environment.
- **Preamble rewrite** — Clean step numbering (0–5), fixed MCP detection to always run (was skipped for returning users with saved accountId), eliminated duplicate `listConnectedAccounts` calls, explicit deep-merge instructions for settings.json to avoid clobbering existing env vars.
- **Removed `apiKey` from config schema** — Config files (`.adsagent.json`, `config.json`) now only store `accountId`. API key storage is exclusively in `~/.claude/settings.json`.

---

## [0.9.8.0] — 2026-04-08

### Added
- **API key verification gate** — The `/ads` skill now checks for `ADSAGENT_API_KEY` in `~/.claude/settings.json` before executing any other step. If the key is missing, it prompts the user to obtain one from [adsagent.org](https://adsagent.org), collects the key interactively, and saves it automatically.

---

## [0.9.7] — 2026-04-08

### Changed
- **Plugin-aware auto-upgrade** — Rewrote the upgrade system from the old `~/.claude/skills/` paths to the new `~/.claude/plugins/cache/` plugin model. The upgrade flow now updates the marketplace repo, copies to a versioned cache directory, and updates `installed_plugins.json` directly.
- **Preamble script discovery** — Both `bin/preamble.md` and `google-ads/shared/preamble.md` now find `toprank-update-check` via glob in the plugin cache instead of hardcoded skill paths.

### Removed
- **Legacy skill paths** — Dropped all references to `~/.claude/skills/toprank/`, `~/.claude/skills/stockholm/`, and the `./setup` script that no longer exists in the plugin model.

---

## [0.9.6] — 2026-04-08

### Added
- **Business relevance gate for keyword evaluation** — The `/ads` skill now classifies keywords into Tier 1 (Core), Tier 2 (Adjacent), and Tier 3 (Irrelevant) before applying performance heuristics. Core keywords that directly describe the business are never paused — they get a diagnostic workflow instead.
- **Statistical significance gate** — Conversion-based decisions now require expected conversions >= 3 before acting. Prevents false negatives from small sample sizes.
- **Core Keyword Diagnostic workflow** — 6-step diagnostic for underperforming Tier 1 keywords: statistical significance, sibling comparison, match type analysis, QS subcomponents, position/impression share, and optimization recommendations.

### Changed
- **Wasted spend calculation** excludes Tier 1 (Core) keywords. A core keyword with 0 conversions is an optimization opportunity, not waste.
- **Bid optimization and waste audit workflows** updated to classify keywords by business relevance before applying performance actions.

---

## [0.9.5] — 2026-04-07

### Changed
- **MCP server URL updated** — `adsagent` MCP now points to `https://adsagent.org/api/mcp` (removed `www.` prefix to match the canonical domain).

## [0.9.4] — 2026-04-07

### Changed
- **`seo-analysis` report restructured for clarity** — Phase 6 now leads with "Top Priority Actions" (3–5 items, ordered by expected click impact) instead of 12+ equal-weight sections. Each action requires a specific URL, specific metric as evidence, and a copy-paste-ready fix with estimated click impact. Supporting data (indexing issues, cannibalization, gaps, schema, technical) is condensed into reference tables shown only when findings exist.
- **`seo-analysis` audit history tracking** — new Step 0.5 reads `~/.toprank/audit-log/<domain>.json` at startup to surface previously flagged issues and their current resolution status. New Phase 6.5 writes a concise log entry after each audit (date, traffic snapshot, top issues with metrics and expected impact). Future audits show which prior issues are resolved, improved, or still open.

### Fixed
- **`seo-analysis` Phase 3.7** — removed duplicate `$DOMAIN` extraction; now reuses the variable set in Step 0.5 instead of re-deriving it.

---

## [0.9.3] — 2026-04-07

### Added
- **SEO business context** (`seo/shared/business-context.md`) — persistent per-domain business profile for SEO skills. Caches business name, summary, industry, primary goal, target audience, locations, brand terms, competitors, and key topics at `~/.toprank/business-context/<domain>.json`. Fresh for 90 days; auto-refreshes when stale.
- **`seo-analysis` Phase 3.8** — business context generation after GSC data is collected. First run asks 3 targeted questions and infers the rest from GSC + homepage. Subsequent runs are silent (cache load only).
- **`seo-analysis` Phase 2 fast-path** — brand terms are loaded from business context cache when available, skipping the manual question entirely.
- **Phase 6 report Business Profile section** — report now opens with a business context block (name, goal, audience, competitors) so all recommendations read as contextual rather than generic.

---

## [0.9.2] — 2026-04-06

### Changed
- **Config resolution** — replaced single global config (`~/.adsagent/config.json`) with 3-tier chain: project-level (`.adsagent.json`), Claude project-level (`~/.claude/projects/{path}/adsagent.json`), and global fallback. Fields merge up the chain so a project file with only `accountId` inherits `apiKey` from global.
- **Project-scoped data storage** — when a project-level config exists, data files (business-context, personas, change-log, account-baseline) are stored in `.adsagent/` relative to the project root instead of globally
- **Account switching** — now asks whether to save the selection for the current project or globally
- **Security** — preamble instructs LLM to add `.adsagent.json` and `.adsagent/` to `.gitignore` when using project-local storage

---

## [0.9.1] — 2026-04-04

### Added
- **Google Ads Setup section** in README — two-path install guide: Option A (free hosted server via adsagent.org) and Option B (self-hosted MCP server for users with their own Google Ads API access)
- Collapsible manual MCP config block for users who skip the setup script

### Changed
- **`/ads` skill** — MCP is now the only tool-calling method. Removed mcporter CLI fallback and `mcporter.json` config file. The "Calling tools" section now documents the `mcp__adsagent__<toolName>` pattern directly.
- **`setup`** — MCP server config is built inline instead of reading from `mcporter.json`. Ads skill detection uses directory prefix instead of file existence check. Fixed Windows path compatibility for ads skill detection.
- **README hook questions** — rewritten to target real pain points: wasted ad spend, traffic drops, and conversion growth without budget increases

### Removed
- **`google-ads/ads/mcporter.json`** — no longer needed; MCP server config is generated directly by the setup script.
- **`_replace_key()` helper** in setup — was only used for mcporter placeholder substitution.

---

## [0.8.0] — 2026-03-31

### Added
- **`/setup-cms` skill** — interactive wizard to connect WordPress, Strapi, Contentful, or Ghost. Detects existing config, collects credentials, tests the connection, and writes to `.env.local`.
- **WordPress CMS integration** (Phase 3.6) — `preflight_wordpress.py` + `fetch_wordpress_content.py`. REST API with Application Password auth. Extracts SEO fields from Yoast SEO (`yoast_head_json`) or RankMath (`meta.rank_math_title`).
- **Contentful CMS integration** (Phase 3.6) — `preflight_contentful.py` + `fetch_contentful_content.py`. Delivery API with Bearer token auth. Resolves linked SEO component entries (`include=1`), supports pagination up to 1000 entries/page.
- **Ghost CMS integration** (Phase 3.6) — `preflight_ghost.py` + `fetch_ghost_content.py`. Content API with auto-detection between v4+ (`/ghost/api/content/`) and v3 (`/ghost/api/v3/content/`). Uses native `meta_title`/`meta_description` fields.
- **`cms_detect.py`** — lightweight CMS routing script. Checks env vars in priority order (WP_URL → Contentful → Ghost → Strapi), exits 0 with CMS name if found, exits 2 if none configured.
- **56 unit tests** (`test/unit/test_cms_scripts.py`) covering SEO field extraction, entry normalisation, SEO audit aggregation, SSRF protection, and WordPress auth header encoding across all 4 CMSes.

### Changed
- **`seo-analysis` Phase 3.6** — rewritten from Strapi-specific to CMS-agnostic. Now routes through `cms_detect.py` and runs the appropriate preflight + fetch script via `case` statement. All CMSes produce the same normalized JSON format.
- Report template: "Strapi SEO Field Audit" → "CMS SEO Field Audit" (supports WordPress, Strapi, Contentful, Ghost).

### Fixed
- **Ghost/WordPress/Contentful false negatives** — SEO extraction no longer falls back to the content title when no explicit meta title is set. Entries with no SEO plugin / no meta title override are now correctly flagged as `missing_meta_title=True`.
- **Ghost `detect_api_path` sys.exit trap** — replaced `ghost_get()` probe (which calls `sys.exit(1)` on errors) with inline `urllib` probe, allowing the v3 API path fallback to actually run.
- **Ghost `PAGE_SIZE`** — changed from 15 (display default) to 100 (actual API max).

---

## [0.7.1] — 2026-04-01

### Fixed
- **`seo-analysis` — GSC display crash** — added `show_gsc.py` display utility to replace fragile inline Python scripts. Fixes `TypeError: string indices must be integers, not 'str'` that occurred when iterating `comparison` dict fields (which mixes string metadata and list data at the same level). Also fixes CTR being displayed as 474% instead of 4.74% (was being multiplied by 100 twice).

---

## [0.7.0] — 2026-04-01

### Added
- **`seo-analysis` — URL-first flow** — Step 0 now asks for the target website URL before running any preflight or API calls. The URL is stored and used throughout the entire audit for URL Inspection, technical crawl, and metadata fetching.
- **`seo-analysis` — URL Inspection API** (Phase 3.5) — new `url_inspection.py` script calls `POST https://searchconsole.googleapis.com/v1/urlInspection/index:inspect` for the top pages. Returns per-page indexing status (`INDEXED`, `NOT_INDEXED`, `DUPLICATE_WITHOUT_CANONICAL`, etc.), mobile usability verdict, rich result status, last crawl time, and referring sitemaps. Results surface immediately as critical flags in the report.
- **`seo-analysis` — Keyword Gap Analysis** (Phase 4.5) — finds keyword orphans (queries ranking 4-20 with no dedicated page), builds topic clusters from GSC data with pillar page recommendations, and identifies business-relevant keywords the site should rank for but has no impressions for.
- **`seo-analysis` — Deep Metadata Audit** — for each audited page, fetches the live `<title>` and `<meta description>`, cross-references against top GSC queries for title/query alignment, checks character counts, detects duplicate titles, and audits Open Graph tags. Outputs a structured per-page table.
- **`seo-analysis` — Deep Schema Markup Audit** — detects site type (E-commerce, SaaS, Local Business, etc.), defines expected schema types per site type, audits each page's `<script type="application/ld+json">` blocks, and flags missing high-impact schema and errors in existing schema. Cross-references with URL Inspection rich result findings.
- **`seo-analysis` — Skill Handoffs** (Phase 7) — after delivering the report, surfaces targeted follow-up actions: `/meta-tags-optimizer` for pages with metadata issues, `/schema-markup-generator` for schema gaps, `/keyword-research` with seed terms from the gap analysis.
- **Branded vs non-branded segmentation** (`branded_split`) — pass `--brand-terms "Acme,AcmeCorp"` to split all GSC traffic into branded and non-branded segments. Each segment gets its own clicks, impressions, CTR, average position, query count, and top-20 queries. Non-branded metrics become the true baseline for Quick Wins and content recommendations. Returns `null` if no brand terms provided.
- **Page group clustering** (`page_groups`) — automatically buckets top pages by URL path pattern (/blog/, /products/, /locations/, /services/, /pricing/, /docs/, /about/, /faq/, /lp/, /case-studies/) with per-section aggregate stats. Exposes template-level problems: "all /products/ pages have 0.8% CTR" can be fixed once, not 50 times.
- **Winner/loser scoring for cannibalization** — each `cannibalization` entry now includes `winner_page`, `winner_reason`, `loser_pages`, and `recommended_action` ("consolidate: 301 redirect..." or "monitor: possible SERP domination").
- **`test/unit/test_url_inspection.py`** — 25 unit tests covering `normalize_site_url_for_inspection`, `parse_inspection_result`, and `summarize_findings`.
- **35 new unit tests** covering `classify_branded`, `derive_branded_split`, `cluster_page_groups`, and all new cannibalization fields.
- **Strapi CMS integration** (Phase 3.6) — the `/seo-analysis` skill now cross-references your published Strapi content against GSC data. Three new scripts:
  - **`preflight_strapi.py`** — validates config, tests connectivity, detects Strapi v4 vs v5. Exit code 2 = not configured (non-fatal skip).
  - **`fetch_strapi_content.py`** — paginates all published entries, extracts SEO fields from the official `strapi-community/plugin-seo` component and root-level fallbacks, writes a structured JSON audit.
  - **`push_strapi_seo.py`** — batch write-back with before/after diff preview, stale-write guard, and locale support for v5 localized content.
- **59 new unit tests** for the Strapi scripts — version detection, entry normalisation, SEO audit counting, payload building, stale-write guard logic, and SSRF IP classification.

### Changed
- **`seo-analysis` — `analyze_gsc.py` parallelized** — all 9 GSC API calls now run concurrently via `ThreadPoolExecutor`, cutting wall-clock data collection time by ~70%. Each worker has an exception guard so a single failed call logs an error and continues rather than crashing the script.
- **`url_inspection.py` — parallel URL inspection** — inspections run with `--concurrency 3` (default). `--max-urls` default reduced from 20 to 5 to stay well within the 2000/day API quota. Worker failures are caught and logged without aborting the run.
- **`seo-analysis` — technical crawl capped at 5 pages** — Phase 5 now has a hard cap of 5 pages (homepage first, then top by clicks, then flagged pages) to keep the audit fast without losing insight.
- **`seo-analysis` — broader OAuth scope** — re-auth instructions throughout the skill now include both `webmasters` and `webmasters.readonly` scopes, required for the URL Inspection API.
- **`seo-analysis`** Phase 2 now asks for brand terms before pulling data.
- **`seo-analysis`** Phase 4 adds "Branded vs Non-Branded Split" and "Page Group Performance" sections.
- **`seo-analysis/evals/evals.json`** — 3-scenario test suite covering URL-first behavior, no-GSC technical fallback, and comprehensive GSC+inspection audit.
- Cannibalization `competing_pages` now sorted by position ascending (best first) instead of clicks descending.
- Strapi integration is **opt-in and non-blocking** — if `STRAPI_URL` is not configured, Phase 3.6 skips silently.

---

## [0.6.1] — 2026-03-31

### Added
- **`test/install.test.sh`** — mock-HOME install test suite for `./setup`. 61 assertions across 6 scenarios: Claude Code global install (symlinks, targets, preamble injection), auto-detect via path, idempotency, real-directory protection, Codex install (openai.yaml + SKILL.md symlinks), and invalid `--host` flag handling. Includes a count-guard that fails fast if a new skill is added to the repo without updating the test's SKILLS array.

### Changed
- **`seo-analysis`** — deeper Google Search Console data in every audit. The script now pulls four additional data sets from a single API session:
  - **Cannibalization** (`cannibalization`) — queries where multiple pages compete, with per-page click/impression breakdown. Previously the skill inferred this from single-dimension data; now it uses the real `[query, page]` dimension so every recommendation names specific URLs.
  - **CTR gaps by page** (`ctr_gaps_by_page`) — high-impression, low-CTR pairs at the query+page level. Replaces query-only CTR opportunities so every title/meta rewrite suggestion includes the exact page to fix.
  - **Country split** (`country_split`) — top 20 countries by clicks with CTR and position. Surfaces geo opportunities and region-specific ranking problems.
  - **Search type breakdown** (`search_type_split`) — web, image, video, news, Discover, and Google News traffic shown separately. Many sites have Discover or image traffic they don't know about.
- `device_split` now includes CTR and position alongside clicks and impressions.
- Phase 4 analysis guidance updated to use the new data fields directly.
- New "Segment Analysis" subsection added to Phase 4 for device, country, and search type interpretation.
- Unit tests: 49 → 79 (+30 tests covering all new functions with boundary and edge case coverage).

---

## [0.6.0] — 2026-03-30

### Added
- **`keyword-research`** — new skill for keyword discovery, intent classification, difficulty assessment, opportunity scoring, and topic clustering. Includes reference materials for intent taxonomy, prioritization framework, cluster templates, and example reports.
- **`meta-tags-optimizer`** — new skill for creating and optimizing title tags, meta descriptions, Open Graph, and Twitter Card tags with A/B test variations and CTR analysis. Includes reference materials for tag formulas, CTR benchmarks, and code templates.
- **`schema-markup-generator`** — new skill for generating JSON-LD structured data (FAQ, HowTo, Article, Product, LocalBusiness, etc.) with validation guidance and rich result eligibility checks. Includes reference materials for schema templates, decision tree, and validation guide.
- **`geo-content-optimizer`** — new skill for optimizing content to appear in AI-generated responses (ChatGPT, Perplexity, Google AI Overviews, Claude). Scores GEO readiness and applies citation, authority, and structure optimization techniques. Includes reference materials for AI citation patterns, GEO techniques, and quotable content examples.

### Changed
- **README.md** — updated with documentation for all 4 new skills, expanded install instructions and directory tree

---

## [0.5.1] — 2026-03-27

### Security
- **Predictable /tmp paths** — `analyze_gsc.py` and `list_gsc_sites.py` now use `gsc_analysis_{uid}.json` / `gsc_sites_{uid}.json` via `tempfile.gettempdir()` + `os.getuid()`, preventing cross-user data exposure on multi-user systems
- **`.gstack/` gitignored** — local security audit reports excluded from git history
- **Test dependency lockfile** — added `requirements-test.lock` (pip-compiled) to pin test dependencies and prevent supply-chain drift

---

## [0.5.0] — 2026-03-27

### Added
- **`preflight.py`** — pre-flight check that runs before any GSC operations; detects gcloud with OS-specific install instructions (Homebrew / apt / dnf / curl / winget), auto-triggers `gcloud auth` browser flow if no ADC credentials found
- **`setup.py`** — cross-platform Python equivalent of `./setup` for Windows users who can't run bash; falls back to directory junctions (no admin rights required) when symlinks are unavailable
- **Phase 0 in SKILL.md** — preflight step added before GSC access check; also restores the "skip GSC → Phase 5" escape hatch for technical-only audits

### Changed
- **`seo-analysis/SKILL.md`** — Phase 1 simplified (error cases now handled by preflight); Phase 1 bash block is self-contained (no shell variable leak from Phase 0)

---

## [0.4.2] — 2026-03-27

### Added
- **README demo section** — "See It Work" example conversation showing end-to-end `/seo-analysis` flow for clearer onboarding

### Changed
- **Auto-upgrade on every skill use** — removed the 4-option prompt (Yes / Always / Not now / Never); updates now apply automatically whenever `UPGRADE_AVAILABLE` is detected
- **Update check frequency** — reduced UP_TO_DATE cache TTL from 60 min to 5 min so checks run on nearly every skill invocation
- **Zero-dependency GSC auth** — removed `google-auth` Python package requirement; reverts 0.4.1 approach; scripts now call `gcloud auth application-default print-access-token` directly via subprocess and use stdlib `urllib` for HTTP, eliminating the `pip install` setup step
- **`gsc_auth.py` removed** — auth logic inlined in `list_gsc_sites.py` and `analyze_gsc.py`; simpler, no shared module
- **SKILL.md Phase 1** — GSC setup instructions updated to reflect the simpler auth flow

### Security
- **Predictable /tmp paths** — GSC output files now use `gsc_analysis_{uid}.json` and `gsc_sites_{uid}.json` instead of shared paths, preventing cross-user data exposure on multi-user systems
- **`.gstack/` gitignored** — security audit reports are now excluded from git commits
- **Test dependency lockfile** — added `requirements-test.lock` (pip-compiled) to pin exact versions and prevent supply-chain drift

---

## [0.4.1] — 2026-03-27

### Fixed
- **GSC quota project header** — replaced raw `urllib` HTTP calls with `google-auth` library (`AuthorizedSession`), which automatically sends the `x-goog-user-project` header required for ADC user credentials; this was the root cause of 403 errors during onboarding
- **Auto-detect quota project** — scripts now read `quota_project_id` from ADC credentials and fall back to `gcloud config get-value project` if missing, eliminating the manual `set-quota-project` step

### Changed
- **Shared auth module** — extracted `gsc_auth.py` with `get_credentials()`, `get_session()`, and `_ensure_quota_project()` to eliminate duplicated auth logic between `list_gsc_sites.py` and `analyze_gsc.py`
- **SKILL.md Phase 1** — streamlined GSC setup instructions from ~50 lines to ~25 lines for faster onboarding and lower token usage
- **gsc_setup.md** — updated setup guide to reflect 2-step process (`pip install google-auth` + `gcloud auth application-default login`) and documented new troubleshooting entries

### Added
- **`google-auth` dependency** — new pip requirement for proper Google API authentication
- **4 new unit tests** for `_ensure_quota_project()` covering: already-set, auto-detect from gcloud, gcloud not found, gcloud returns empty

---

## [0.4.0] — 2026-03-27

### Added
- **`content-writer` skill** — standalone SEO content creation, directly invocable without running a full SEO audit
  - Handles three jobs: new blog posts, new landing pages, and improving existing pages
  - 6-step workflow: determine job → gather context → read guidelines → research & plan → write → quality gate
  - Follows Google's E-E-A-T and Helpful Content guidelines via shared reference doc
  - Outputs publication-ready content with SEO metadata, JSON-LD structured data, internal linking plan, and publishing checklist
  - Smart content type detection from user intent (informational → blog, transactional → landing page)
- **`content-writing.md` reference doc** — single source of truth for Google content best practices (E-E-A-T framework, helpful content signals, blog/landing page templates, search intent matching, on-page SEO checklist, anti-patterns including AI content pitfalls)
- **`seo-analysis` Phase 7** — optional content generation after audit; spawns up to 5 content agents in parallel when content gaps are identified, each reading the shared `content-writing.md` guidelines

### Changed
- **CONTRIBUTING.md** — expanded with detailed SKILL.md structure, script requirements, reference file guidelines, and skill ideas table
- **README.md** — added `content-writer` to skills table and updated project description

---

## [0.3.0] — 2026-03-27

### Added
- **Python test suite** — full pytest infrastructure under `test/` replacing the prior TypeScript/Bun approach; no build step required
  - `test/unit/` — 42 fast unit tests (stdlib only, no API calls); covers date math, GSC data processing, report structure, and skill SKILL.md content validation
  - `test/test_skill_e2e.py` — E2E skill tests gated behind `EVALS=1`; uses mock `gcloud` + mock `analyze_gsc.py` fixture to run the full skill workflow without real credentials
  - `test/test_skill_llm_eval.py` — LLM-as-judge quality evals gated behind `EVALS=1`; scores report clarity, actionability, and phase coverage on a 1–5 scale
  - `test/test_skill_routing_e2e.py` — routing evals verify the skill triggers on SEO prompts and stays silent on unrelated requests
  - `test/helpers/` — session runner (spawns `claude -p --output-format stream-json`), LLM judge, eval store, and diff-based test selection
  - `test/fixtures/` — mock gcloud binary, mock analyze_gsc.py, and sample GSC JSON fixture data
  - `conftest.py` — root-level pytest config for import path setup
  - `requirements-test.txt` — minimal test dependencies

### Fixed
- **Routing tests** — added harness failure guard; `should-not-trigger` tests no longer silently pass when the subprocess times out or crashes
- **Env isolation** — test subprocess now strips `ANTHROPIC_*` vars (in addition to `CLAUDE_*`) to prevent `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL` or `ANTHROPIC_MODEL` from redirecting evals to an unintended endpoint
- **LLM judge retry** — exponential backoff (3 attempts: 1s, 2s, 4s) replaces single-retry on rate limit
- **Mock gcloud** — removed fall-through to real `gcloud` binary that caused infinite recursion when mock was first in PATH
- **`.gitignore`** — restored credential patterns (`credentials.json`, `token.json`, `.env`, etc.) accidentally dropped in initial commit

---

## [0.2.3] — 2026-03-27

### Changed
- Simplified CONTRIBUTING.md — removed skill ideas table and verbose guidelines, kept essentials for getting started

---

## [0.2.2] — 2026-03-27

### Changed
- Rewrote README intro for clarity and power — headline now communicates that Toprank analyzes, recommends, and fixes SEO issues directly in your repo

---

## [0.2.0] — 2026-03-27

### Added
- **Autoupdate system** — skills now check GitHub for new versions on every invocation
  - `bin/toprank-update-check` — fetches `VERSION` from GitHub with 60-min cache; outputs `UPGRADE_AVAILABLE <old> <new>` or nothing
  - `bin/toprank-config` — read/write `~/.toprank/config.yaml`; supports `update_check`, `auto_upgrade` keys
  - `toprank-upgrade/SKILL.md` — upgrade skill with inline and standalone flows, snooze (24h/48h/7d backoff), auto-upgrade mode, changelog diff
  - Preamble in `seo-analysis` and auto-inject via `setup` for all future skills
  - `bin/preamble.md` — single source of truth for the preamble template
- `VERSION` file — tracks current release for update checks

### Fixed
- `toprank-update-check`: validate local VERSION format before writing cache; exit after `JUST_UPGRADED` to prevent dual stdout output; move `mkdir -p` to top of script
- `setup`: atomic SKILL.md writes via temp file + `os.replace()`; add `pipefail` to catch silent Python errors
- `toprank-upgrade`: clear stale `.bak` before vendored upgrade to prevent collision

---

## [0.2.1] — 2026-03-27

### Changed
- **`seo-analysis` Phase 1** — replaced two-step auth check (token print + separate site list) with single `list_gsc_sites.py` call that tests auth, scopes, and GSC access in one shot; added distinct handling for each failure mode (wrong account, wrong scopes, API not enabled, gcloud not installed)
- **`seo-analysis` script paths** — replaced hardcoded `~/.claude/skills/seo-analysis/scripts/` with a `find`-based `SKILL_SCRIPTS` lookup that works for Claude Code, Codex, and custom install paths; added guard for empty result so missing installs fail with a clear error instead of a confusing path error
- **`seo-analysis` property selection** — added explicit rule to prefer domain property (`sc-domain:example.com`) over URL-prefix when both exist for the same site
- **`gsc_setup.md`** — moved "Which Google Account" guidance to top (most common failure cause); replaced broken `oauth_setup.py` Option B with Linux (Debian/Ubuntu, RPM) and Windows install instructions; fixed deprecated `apt-key` with `gpg --dearmor` for Debian 12+/Ubuntu 24.04+; expanded troubleshooting to cover `insufficient_scope` 403s

### Fixed
- **`list_gsc_sites.py`** — unhandled `FileNotFoundError` when gcloud is not installed now shows a clean error message; added `URLError` handling for network failures (DNS, TLS, proxy)
- **`analyze_gsc.py`** — same `FileNotFoundError` and `URLError` fixes
- **`gsc_setup.md`** — removed reference to `oauth_setup.py` which did not exist
- **`seo-analysis` SKILL.md** — corrected error-branch description from "Python traceback" to "ERROR: gcloud not found" to match the actual script output

---

## [0.1.1] — 2026-03-27

### Changed
- **README intro** — rewritten to lead with user outcome ("Finally know what to do about your SEO") and emphasize zero-risk install; blockquote examples now show real questions users would type

---

## [0.1.0] — 2026-03-26

### Added
- **`seo-analysis` skill** — comprehensive SEO audit powered by Google Search Console
  - Phase 1: GSC API setup detection and guided auth via `gcloud` Application Default Credentials
  - Phase 2: Auto-detect site URL from website repo (`package.json`, `next.config.js`, `astro.config.*`, etc.) or prompt for URL
  - Phase 3: Data collection — top queries, top pages, position buckets (1–3, 4–10, 11–20, 21+), CTR opportunities, 28-day period comparison, device split
  - Phase 4a: Search Console analysis — quick wins, content gaps, traffic drops
  - Phase 4b: Technical SEO audit — indexability, meta tags, heading structure, structured data, performance signals
  - Phase 5: Structured report with executive summary, traffic snapshot, and 30-day action plan
- `scripts/list_gsc_sites.py` — list all GSC properties for the authenticated account
- `scripts/analyze_gsc.py` — pull and process GSC data, output structured JSON
- `references/gsc_setup.md` — complete setup guide for gcloud ADC and OAuth fallback
