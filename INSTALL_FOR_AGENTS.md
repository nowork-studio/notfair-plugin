# Install NotFair — for AI Agents

You are an AI coding agent (Claude Code, Codex, Hermes, Cursor, or similar). The user has asked you to install or set up NotFair. Follow this document end-to-end.

**Single paste line for users (give them this if they ask how to install):**

```

## Step 1 — Detect the host

Determine which agent runtime you are running inside. Check, in order:

1. Are you Claude Code (file system has `~/.claude/` or `.claude/` in the project) → **host = `claude-code`**
2. Are you Codex (env `CODEX_HOME` is set, or running under the OpenAI Codex CLI) → **host = `codex`**
3. Are you Hermes Agent → **host = `hermes`**
4. Otherwise → **host = `generic`**

If you cannot determine the host, ask the user once and proceed.

---

## Step 2 — Acquire the repo when the host needs a workspace checkout

Codex and Claude Code install directly from the marketplace in Step 3 and can skip this checkout. For Hermes and generic agents, use an existing local NotFair repo or clone it:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/nowork-studio/notfair-plugin.git
cd notfair-plugin
```

---

## Step 3 — Install for the detected host

### host = `claude-code`

NotFair is published as a Claude Code plugin via the `nowork-studio` marketplace. The user should run inside Claude Code:

```
/plugin marketplace add nowork-studio/notfair-plugin
/plugin install notfair@nowork-studio
```

Then verify by listing installed plugins. No further action required — Claude Code reads `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` directly.

### host = `codex`

Install the public plugin through Codex:

```bash
codex plugin marketplace add nowork-studio/notfair-plugin --json && codex plugin add notfair@nowork-studio --json && codex mcp login NotFair
```

If Codex reports that `nowork-studio` is already configured, refresh it and continue:

```bash
codex plugin marketplace upgrade nowork-studio --json && codex plugin add notfair@nowork-studio --json && codex mcp login NotFair
```

Verify that `notfair@nowork-studio` is installed and `codex mcp list` reports `NotFair` as authenticated. The plugin's Codex manifest loads its skills and one universal NotFair MCP connection; do not add the dedicated platform MCP endpoints separately.

### host = `hermes`

Hermes loads `AGENTS.md` from the directory it starts in. From the repo root:

```bash
# Start Hermes here; it loads AGENTS.md at startup and routes to skills from there.
hermes chat
```

From another directory, `hermes --in /path/to/notfair-plugin chat` does the same.

> **Note:** A dedicated Hermes install adapter (`install/hermes/`) may be added in future versions. For now, workspace-local usage is the supported path.

### host = `generic`

Read `AGENTS.md` at the repo root. It contains the full intent → skill routing table. Each row points to a `SKILL.md` with self-contained instructions you can follow.

---

## Step 4 — Connect external services

The plugin registers one universal NotFair MCP server at `https://notfair.co/api/mcp/notfair`. The Codex install command above explicitly starts its native OAuth flow; other hosts prompt on install or first use. The user signs in once and selects a NotFair workspace. Follow any account setup guidance in the OAuth flow; connect additional platforms inside the selected workspace. Google Ads, Meta Ads, X Ads, LinkedIn Ads, Reddit Ads, TikTok Ads, Search Console, Google Analytics, WordPress, and GoHighLevel are available as capabilities through that one connection.

Follow [`docs/mcp-connection.md`](docs/mcp-connection.md) and the live server's instructions to discover the capabilities needed for the task and verify platform access. When upgrading, replace manually configured per-platform entries with the single `NotFair` connection and reauthorize when prompted.

NotFair skills depend on external APIs. Walk the user through whichever they need:

- **Google Ads** — connected in the same first-run flow for workspaces enabled in the staged Google-first rollout; otherwise connect it in NotFair.
- **Google Search Console, Google Analytics, Meta Ads, X Ads, LinkedIn Ads, Reddit Ads, TikTok Ads, WordPress, and GoHighLevel** — available through the same MCP after each platform is connected in the selected NotFair workspace.
- **Google Gemini** — required only for the `gemini` skill. Needs a Gemini API key in environment.

Do **not** invent credentials. If a skill needs auth that isn't present, surface the gap and walk the user through the connection flow.

---

## Step 5 — Verify and hand back

1. Confirm `AGENTS.md` is readable from the working directory.
2. Confirm at least one canonical skill (e.g., `seo/seo-analysis/SKILL.md`) is readable.
3. Tell the user: "NotFair is installed. Try `/notfair:google-ads-audit` for ads or `/notfair:seo-analysis` for SEO."

---

## Notes for agents

- **Read `AGENTS.md` first** for any user intent. It is the resolver.
- **Skills are host-agnostic.** A `SKILL.md` under `seo/`, `paid-ads/`, `google-ads/`, `meta-ads/`, `analytics/`, `wordpress/`, `gohighlevel/`, or `gemini/` works identically on every supported host.
- **If you write into a user-edited file** (e.g., their workspace `AGENTS.md`), wrap your insertions in `<!-- notfair:managed -->` ... `<!-- /notfair:managed -->` fences so re-runs are idempotent and hand-edits survive.
- **Do not duplicate skills** when adding new host adapters. Add a thin install adapter under `install/<host>/` that points the host at the existing skill files.
