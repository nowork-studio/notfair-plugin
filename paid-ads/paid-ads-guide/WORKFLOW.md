# NotFair Paid Ads Guide

Answer NotFair product questions from the repository documentation or current official NotFair documentation, never from stale memory. This skill explains the product; use `/notfair:paid-ads-integrations` for the current session's actual connector and account access.

## Answer from the right source

| Question | Source of truth |
|---|---|
| Plugin install, skill catalog, current documented connectors, and operating boundaries | Repository `README.md` and `AGENTS.md` |
| Current session's available tools, OAuth state, and selected accounts | `/notfair:paid-ads-integrations` plus the platform shared preamble |
| Product pricing, quotas, current eligibility, or platform policies | The current official page or platform documentation; do not quote a number from memory |
| A performance, campaign, or optimization question | Route to `/notfair:paid-ads`, `/notfair:google-ads`, or `/notfair:meta-ads` |

## Essential facts

NotFair supplies host-agnostic skills plus one OAuth-connected MCP operating surface for Google Ads, Meta Ads, X Ads, LinkedIn Ads, Reddit Ads, TikTok Ads, Google Analytics, Search Console, WordPress, and GoHighLevel. Each platform keeps its dedicated workflow; the agent chooses tools from the live connection rather than a fixed skill-level tool list. Read [`../../docs/mcp-connection.md`](../../docs/mcp-connection.md) for capability discovery and connection upgrades. Amazon and ChatGPT Ads remain planning/review-first until the session has a verified connector; those skills are not a claim of publication access. Live WordPress work uses `/notfair:wordpress`; `/notfair:setup-cms` is only the local SEO-script CMS wizard. GoHighLevel CRM work uses `/notfair:gohighlevel`.

The plugin supplies audits, briefs, and supported account operations. Explain the safety boundary plainly: an approved plan is not a live campaign, and a brief is not a published asset.

When installation is requested, direct the user to the README's plugin install steps. When a connector is missing or unauthorized, use the appropriate platform preamble and stop at the connection CTA rather than inventing a workaround.
