# Local Lead-Gen Playbook

Use this archetype for local service businesses such as pet care, bookkeeping, legal, home services, healthcare, and other location-bound lead-gen accounts.

## Core posture

Local-service accounts often have low volume, expensive clicks, and ambiguous `near me` intent. Optimize for qualified leads and booked revenue, not cheap traffic.

## Decision rules

- Do not overfit 1–3 expensive clicks when the query is plausibly high intent.
- Do not raise budget until conversion tracking, query quality, and impression-share constraints are understood.
- If lost impression share to budget is low and lost IS to rank is high, work on relevance/rank/landing page before budget.
- Preserve strategic services with controlled exact/phrase coverage before pausing broad-match discovery.
- Exclude non-buyer intent aggressively when unmistakable: jobs, salary, training, free templates, DIY, irrelevant service lines, out-of-area locations.
- Use client/business input for ambiguous adjacency, e.g. tax-adjacent bookkeeping leads or grooming vs boarding demand.

## Service-line protection

When a broad keyword for a core service is noisy:

1. Identify converting/high-intent search terms.
2. Add exact/phrase anchors for service + city/neighborhood.
3. Add only obvious irrelevant negatives.
4. Improve ad/landing-page message match.
5. Review after enough spend/clicks; then decide whether broad still earns its keep.

## Lead quality loop

Google Ads conversions are not enough. When possible, connect:

- lead form submissions
- phone calls
- booked consults/reservations
- closed customers
- revenue/LTV

Judge terms by qualified lead or booking quality once that data exists.

- Check what the primary conversion counts before comparing CPLs. A form conversion that fires on every submit can report well above the leads the CRM keeps, and the gap can differ by campaign.
- Keep the qualified or booked rate per campaign in `business-context.json` (`lead_quality`) and compare campaigns on cost per booking. Two campaigns with the same CPL can differ several times over in cost per booked customer.
- Ask whether the business runs other ad accounts for the same locations, especially Local Services Ads. Record them under `linked_accounts`; budget moves between Search and LSA need both views.

## Output priorities

For local accounts, reports should emphasize:

- spend by service/location intent
- expensive no-lead terms
- query relevance
- rank vs budget constraint
- lead quality questions
- next watch threshold

## Anti-patterns

- Killing a core service keyword before replacing it with exact/phrase coverage.
- Treating all zero-conversion local clicks as bad on tiny volume.
- Optimizing for CPC when high-value local leads are inherently expensive.
- Ignoring geography and service-area fit.
